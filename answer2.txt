Waterfall Diagram for Web-Based Game (Flask + Sockets):

1. Client connects to server at localhost:5000
   |
2. Server creates a new game session and initializes player position
   |
3. Server sends initial game state (player position inside 500x500 box) to client
   |
4. Client renders the 500x500 box and draws the player at the initial position
   |
5. User presses 'A' (move left) or 'D' (move right)
   |
6. Client captures the keydown event and sends a movement command to the server via socket
   |
7. Server receives the movement command, updates the player's position (ensuring it stays inside the box)
   |
8. Server sends the updated game state (new player position) back to the client
   |
9. Client receives the updated position and re-renders the player in the new position
   |
10. Repeat steps 5-9 as the user continues to play

eventlet in Python:
Eventlet is a networking library for Python that provides asynchronous I/O using green threads, enabling your Flask server to handle many socket connections concurrently and efficiently. It is often used as the async worker for Flask-SocketIO.

Alternatives to eventlet include:
- gevent: another greenlet-based async networking library
- asyncio: Python's standard asynchronous I/O framework (with `async`/`await`)
- threading: Python's built-in threads (less scalable for network I/O)
- gunicorn with gevent or eventlet workers (for deployment)
