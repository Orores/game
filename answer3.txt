  |         position, updates state)    |
  |<------ emit('state', {x}) ----------|
  |                                     |
  | (Client updates sprite position)    |

  |                                     |
  |------- (disconnect) --------------->|
  |       (Server cleans up)            |
  |                                     |

----------------------------------------
To make movement fluid (not "cutting"):

- Do not emit 'move' only once per key press.
- Instead, on the client, when a movement key is held down ('A' or 'D'):
    - Start a timer/interval (e.g., setInterval in JS) that emits 'move' events repeatedly while the key is held.
    - Stop emitting when the key is released (onkeyup).
- Server continues to handle incoming move events and returns updated positions.
- This creates a continuous, fluid movement as long as the key is held.
