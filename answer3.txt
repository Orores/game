To make the scroll wheel more sensitive (so the user can adjust the ghost delay more per scroll), but **limit the maximum rate at which the server actually changes the delay**, follow these steps:

---

**1. Client-side: Make scroll wheel more sensitive**

- In `client/main.js`, increase the amount of scroll events generated per scroll (browser-dependent), or, more simply, **send a delay change request with a larger magnitude per scroll**:
    ```js
    // When wheel event is detected:
    let scrollAmount = e.deltaY < 0 ? 1 : -1; // Or use e.deltaY directly for more sensitivity
    socket.emit('delay_change', { amount: scrollAmount });
    ```
    You could also send a value proportional to `e.deltaY` for even more control.

---

**2. Server-side: Throttle/max-rate state change**

- In `server/app.py`, instead of immediately increasing/decreasing the delay on every scroll event, introduce a **rate limiter** per player for how quickly their delay can change, e.g. by processing requests but only applying at most X delay units per second.

Example implementation:

```python
DELAY_MAX_CHANGE_PER_SEC = 0.07  # max allowed change per second

@socketio.on('delay_change')
def handle_delay_change(data):
    p = players.get(request.sid)
    if not p:
        return
    now = time.time()
    last_change = p.get('last_delay_change', now)
    since = now - last_change
    # Compute the max allowed change in this interval
    max_change = DELAY_MAX_CHANGE_PER_SEC * since
    requested = float(data.get('amount', 0)) * DELAY_CHANGE_RATE
    # Clamp to max_change
    applied = max(-max_change, min(requested, max_change))
    new_delay = p.get('delay', DEFAULT_GHOST_DELAY) + applied
    p['delay'] = max(MIN_GHOST_DELAY, min(MAX_GHOST_DELAY, new_delay))
    p['last_delay_change'] = now
```

**Replace your old `delay_inc`/`delay_dec` handlers with a single `delay_change` event as above.**

---

**Summary**

- The client can scroll as fast/hard as it likes to request delay changes (even sending large values).
- The server only allows the player's delay value to change by at most a fixed rate per second, regardless of scroll speed or amount.
- This ensures sensitivity on the client, but smooth, rate-limited state on the server.

---

**Files to update:**
- `client/main.js`: emit `delay_change` with desired amount (possibly proportional to scroll)
- `server/app.py`: implement the rate-limited `delay_change` handler as above

No changes are needed for ghost, movement, or shooting logic.
