To make the game continuously update on the client side (even without input), you need the server to periodically send updated game states to all connected clients, not just in response to movement inputs. Here’s how you can do it:

**1. Add a periodic update loop on the server:**
Use a background task (for example, with Flask-SocketIO’s `start_background_task` and `socketio.sleep`) to regularly emit the current game state to all clients.

**2. Remove redundant `emit_game_state()` calls if desired:**  
You can keep or remove emitting state after every move/disconnect, depending on how responsive you want the game to be.

**3. Client-side:**  
No changes are needed; the client will now receive regular state updates and redraw even when no input is sent.

**Summary:**  
Add a server-side periodic broadcast of the game state using a background task. This way, clients keep receiving updates and ghost positions move smoothly, even when players aren't pressing keys.
