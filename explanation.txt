Implementation Explanation for 2-Player Circle Movement Game

Overview:
You will create a simple real-time browser game for 2 players. Both players connect to the server via their browsers. Each controls a circle (using WASD keys). All movement logic is handled server-side using Python. The server sends position updates to clients.

Stack:
- Backend: Python with Flask + Flask-SocketIO (for real-time WebSocket communication)
- Frontend: HTML + JavaScript (communicates via WebSockets to receive/send circle positions)

File Descriptions:
- server/app.py: Main server logic. Handles client connections, user input (WASD), updates circle positions, and broadcasts game state to clients.
- server/requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies (Flask, Flask-SocketIO, etc.).
- client/index.html: Renders game area (canvas). Loads JS and CSS.
- client/main.js: Handles keyboard events, connects to server, sends input events, receives and renders updated positions.
- client/style.css: Optional styling for the page.
- README.md: Project description and usage instructions.
- empty.txt: Reference placeholder.

Key Objects & Functions:

Server (app.py):
- Player (object): Represents a connected player (id, color, position x/y).
- players (dict): Stores all connected players.
- handle_connect(): Registers new client, assigns player object.
- handle_disconnect(): Removes player on client disconnect.
- handle_input(data): Receives movement input from client, updates player position.
- game_loop(): Periodically emits updated positions to all clients.

Client (main.js):
- socket: SocketIO connection to server.
- handleKeyDown(event): Sends WASD input to server.
- handleKeyUp(event): (optional, for smooth movement)
- renderGame(state): Draws circles at positions received from server.

How it works:
1. Player opens browser (index.html), JS connects to server via SocketIO.
2. On keypress (WASD), client sends input to server.
3. Server updates player position, checks collisions, etc.
4. Server broadcasts new positions to all clients.
5. Clients redraw circles in new positions.

This structure keeps game logic on the server and client code minimal and focused on rendering/input.
