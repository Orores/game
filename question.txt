I am programming a web based game using python flask and sockets.

1. I connect to localhost 5000
2. Theres a box of 500x500 pixels on the screen
3. I can move left or right using A and D W S
4. The calculation are done server side
5. Support multiple player by broadcoasting.
6. Theres a ghost with delay.
7. Continous emission loop
8. variable ghost delay.
9. server state side.

update the shooting mechanic so it also part of the action stack liek movement.
