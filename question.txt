I am programming a web based game using python flask and sockets.

1. I connect to localhost 5000
2. Theres a box of 500x500 pixels on the screen
3. I can move left or right using A and D W S
4. The calculation are done server side
5. Support multiple player by broadcoasting.
6. Theres a ghost with delay.
7. Continous emission loop

add the varaible delay mechanic, the j and l keys aswell as the display for current delay. define also a variable for change rate when it comes to delay.
