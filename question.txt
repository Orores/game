I am programming a web based game using python flask and sockets.

1. I connect to localhost 5000
2. Theres a box of 500x500 pixels on the screen
3. I can move left or right using A and D W S
4. The calculation are done server side
5. Support multiple player by broadcoasting.
6. Theres a ghost with delay.
7. Continous emission loop

nice now i want to add a button k for shooting a point towards the enemy location. if that point hits the ghost you get a score +1. Have the server refuse any new player if there are already two. How would i implement that?
