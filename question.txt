I am programming a web based game using python flask and sockets.

1. I connect to localhost 5000
2. Theres a box of 500x500 pixels on the screen
3. I can move left or right using A and D W S
4. The calculation are done server side
5. Support multiple player by broadcoasting.

I want to now add a ghost to each player, the ghost does the same movement than a player, but delayed by exactly one second (variable). the shadow of the player has the same color but darker.

How would i implement that?
